Are your bundles dull and boring? Are dyes unable to quench your thirst for detail and aesthetics? Then look no further at the "Designer Bundles" resource pack for Minecraft 1.21.4! This allows you to apply custom designs to your bundles by renaming them to the specific design. It works for all bundle types and should be compatible with future Minecraft versions.

I don't own an account for donations, but if you want to support me you can always check out my YouTube channel. I like to make content on Minecraft and other games I enjoy, and sometimes stream games I'm playing with my friends. There's also my Planet Minecraft page, where I've released another popular resource pack called "Better Trims" that makes trimmed armor more accessible. If any of that interests you, then check out the links below!
